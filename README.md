# Bubble Redemption

The goal is to create a minimal react app to show some info from Reddit.

Ideally exporting subreddits in CSV format and being able to display a list of other subreddits in CSV format.

A list of subreddits can be manually generated using chat-bot, based on:

- current list of subreddits
- a description of yourself, your interests
