# Bubble Redemption

The goal is to create a minimal react app to show some info from News API.

Planned features:

- Search the news
- Display top headlines
- Make a tag cloud from the top headlines


Some useful links:

- [A sample app](https://reddit-client.netlify.app/) by codecademy
- [News API](https://newsapi.org/)
- [Modified rake-js package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shopping24/rake-js/v/2.0.0) to extract keywords from the articles
